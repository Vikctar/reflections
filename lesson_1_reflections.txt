How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	diff outputs the difference between two files, a line that was removed,
	is noted by - sign while one that was added is shown using a +.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	Having access to the history of a file, enables falling back to the 
	old working version incase the new file doesn't work properly as intended.
	It also makes debugging easier.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

	When manually choosing to create a commit, you are able to keep the commits
	tidy, by not having different commits clattered together, which would make 
	it hard to understand.
	Automatically, having your versions saved is nice but in the long run, illogical
	changes are saved. The number of versions become too many.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in
one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history file?
	git log, logs all the commits while git diff shows the differences between two
	commits


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break
something?
	Knownig that i could easily revert to an old working state.


Now that you have your workspace set up, whad do you want to try using Git for?
	Keeping track of my projects
