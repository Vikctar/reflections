What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	An empty repo is created. The repo is not necessarily empty,
	but it contains untracked files.
	Initializing creates a repo that will help track changes made
	to a particular directory.
	
How is the staging area differnt from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area holds files before they are committed to the repository.
	It is an intermediate area that acts as a buffer zone to the repo.
