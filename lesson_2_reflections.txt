What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	An empty repo is created. The repo is not necessarily empty,
	but it contains untracked files.
	Initializing creates a repo that will help track changes made
	to a particular directory.
	
How is the staging area differnt from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area holds files before they are committed to the repository.
	It is an intermediate area that acts as a buffer zone to the repo.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	Using git diff --staged to double check the changes to be committed.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?
How would branches help?
	When working on a chnange that is not too critical to your program,
	or you are not sure whether the changes you want to make will work
	or not.
	Branches make it easier to work on your program i.e introduce changes,
	and still be able to checkout the last known working commit.

How fo the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	Diagrams help make a visual representation of the branches
	and how different commits relate.
