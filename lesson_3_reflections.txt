When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    Remote repos help me keep backups of my project. They are also good when sharing
    code with others. It is also a good way of keeping my work updated in all the
    computers I use.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    Pulling manually helps me make sure that any change i pull, is a working one.
    A new version will not always be a working version. So having it pulled 
    automatically might mean one more bug to fix.
